Go-Board
========

A very fast implementation of a Go board, with Monte-Carlo random playouts. It is implemented using generic programming concepts, with the aim of having a high-level structure without compromising performance. Profile guided optimisation is used for optimal branching avoiding the need to rearrange the order of branches manually.
